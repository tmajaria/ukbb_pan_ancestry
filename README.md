Author: [Tim Majarian](tmajaria@broadinstitute.org)

This repository adapts the Pan UK Biobank ancestry derivation (https://pan.ukbb.broadinstitute.org/) to data from the [Mass General Brigham Biobank](https://www.massgeneral.org/research/division-clinical-research/). Code for running the Pan UK Biobank GWAS & related analyses will not be modified currently.


## Original readme
GWAS across all analyzable phenotypes and diverse ancestry groups in the UK Biobank.

A full description of how these summary statistics were generated and how to work with them can be found here: http://pan.ukbb.broadinstitute.org/.
